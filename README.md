# üåå Philosophy & Design Principles

Building a media server is not just about standing up containers or streaming files ‚Äî it‚Äôs about creating a **digital ecosystem** that balances performance, security, and sustainability. `msi.sh` was designed with this broader perspective in mind, and its guiding principles reflect the lessons learned from years of experimentation in homelabs, cloud deployments, and production environments.

1. **Simplicity as Power**
   Automation is not about hiding complexity but about *managing* it. `msi.sh` follows a declarative approach where your intent (a working media server) is more important than the step-by-step commands. By reducing cognitive overhead, you spend less time debugging arcane Docker flags and more time enjoying your content.

2. **Security by Default**
   Self-hosting carries risks. That‚Äôs why this installer defaults to **local binding** and requires **explicit tunneling** for remote access. Instead of exposing dashboards to the open internet, it nudges you toward safer, VPN-like workflows. This philosophy ensures that convenience never comes at the cost of your privacy or data safety.

3. **Sustainability & Efficiency**
   Media consumption often leans on power-hungry machines and bloated setups. With `msi.sh`, the philosophy is **lean first**: containers are trimmed, transcoding is discouraged (favoring direct play), and maintenance is designed to be light. This helps you save on electricity bills, reduce e-waste, and contribute to a greener digital ecosystem without sacrificing functionality.

4. **Community over Perfection**
   This script will never be "finished." Instead, it is meant to **evolve with its users**. Issues, pull requests, and forks are not signs of weakness but proof of a living project. By encouraging collaboration, the installer grows in directions a single developer could never anticipate.

5. **Future-Readiness**
   The world of self-hosting is fast-moving. New services appear, protocols shift, and yesterday‚Äôs best practices quickly become obsolete. By keeping the installer modular and transparent, `msi.sh` ensures you are never locked into one ‚Äúway of doing things.‚Äù It‚Äôs a foundation, not a cage ‚Äî flexible enough to adapt to the technologies of tomorrow.

In essence, `msi.sh` is less about pushing a button and more about embracing a mindset: **automation that respects your time, protects your data, and scales with your imagination.** Whether you are setting up your very first Jellyfin server or integrating a complex homelab stack, this project is built to grow alongside you.

### üìñ Why Media Servers Matter in 2025

Self-hosting a media server is more than just convenience; it‚Äôs a **cultural and philosophical statement** about the way we interact with digital content. In a world where large corporations increasingly dictate how, when, and where we consume media, a personal media server restores **agency and autonomy** to the individual. Instead of being at the mercy of subscription services that rotate catalogs monthly, self-hosters curate their own collections, ensuring permanence, stability, and freedom.

From a technical standpoint, a media server is an excellent case study in **distributed systems**: it involves storage optimization, network management, data redundancy, and container orchestration. It becomes a personal lab where abstract concepts like reverse proxies, certificate management, or bandwidth shaping turn into practical, lived experiences.

From a sustainability angle, self-hosting fosters **digital stewardship**. By reusing old hardware and optimizing for direct play, one reduces reliance on sprawling server farms that consume enormous amounts of energy. The philosophy aligns with the principles of the **degrowth movement in technology** ‚Äî doing more with less, reducing waste, and encouraging mindful consumption.

And on the human level? Media servers embody the **joy of ownership**. When you stream a film from Jellyfin that you personally archived, you engage with media in a deeper, more meaningful way. You are not a renter in someone else‚Äôs ecosystem; you are the custodian of your own library, a digital archivist preserving culture for yourself and those you care about.

### üìö Long-Form Technical Deep Dive: Automation and Declarative Infrastructure

At its core, `msi.sh` operates on the principle of **infrastructure-as-code**. While larger organizations rely on tools like Terraform, Ansible, or Kubernetes, this project demonstrates that the same philosophy can be scaled down to the homelab. The installer defines not just *what* should be running (e.g., Sonarr, Radarr, Jellyfin), but also *how* those services interconnect.

This declarative approach has several key advantages:

1. **Idempotence** ‚Äì Running the script multiple times should lead to the same stable outcome, avoiding the "works on my machine" problem.
2. **Reproducibility** ‚Äì A user can destroy and recreate their setup without worrying about drift. The configuration is encoded in a version-controlled repository, not scattered across undocumented shell commands.
3. **Portability** ‚Äì Because the stack is containerized, the same script can deploy on bare-metal servers, VMs, or even cloud instances with minimal modification.
4. **Transparency** ‚Äì Unlike black-box installers, `msi.sh` is entirely open and inspectable, teaching users how things *actually work*.

This reflects a broader shift in computing: moving from artisanal, hand-crafted server setups toward automated, self-documenting infrastructure. What enterprises achieve with DevOps pipelines, the self-hoster achieves with a single script.

### üåç The Social Impact of Self-Hosting

We often treat self-hosting as a purely technical pursuit, but it has **social and political implications**. By running your own media server, you reduce reliance on centralized platforms that track behavior, monetize attention, and enforce censorship. This aligns with the philosophy of the **decentralized web**, where individuals reclaim power from gatekeepers.

A future with millions of self-hosted nodes creates a more **resilient internet**: if one service disappears, knowledge and culture persist elsewhere. In this way, even a single Jellyfin box in someone‚Äôs basement contributes to the broader vision of a **federated, user-owned digital commons**.

### üß† A Note on Learning by Doing

Perhaps the most important feature of `msi.sh` is not the software it installs, but the **learning pathway** it creates. Each user who runs the script steps into the world of:

* Docker container management
* Linux networking
* Systemd services
* Security principles like SSH tunneling and firewalls
* Automation workflows

The installer lowers the barrier to entry, but it also leaves enough room for curiosity. Once you‚Äôve got a media server running, you might ask: *What else can I self-host?* That question is the spark that fuels homelabs, side projects, and even future careers in DevOps, SRE, and system architecture.

- Run only on clean or properly configured systems.
- Ensure enough disk space is available for media and containers.
- Script requires root privileges.
- **Jellyfin is configured for Direct Play only** ‚Äî transcoding isn‚Äôt supported in this setup. It's recommended to disable transcoding in the server settings to lighten the load on your CPU, cut down on power use, and be a bit kinder to the planet.
- **Launching containers may take time, especially on first run,** depending on your internet connection speed.

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **Port already in use:** Edit `docker-compose.yml` and change the conflicting port.
- **Docker permission denied:** Ensure your user is in the `docker` group or run with `sudo`.

---

## üßπ Uninstallation

To completely remove all containers, configuration, users, firewall rules, and packages installed by `msi.sh`, use the uninstall script:

> **Note:** For the cleanest recovery, it is highly recommended to create a system snapshot or backup before running these scripts. Restoring from a snapshot is often simpler and more reliable than manual uninstallation.

```bash
chmod +x msi-uninstall.sh
sudo ./msi-uninstall.sh
```

The script will prompt for confirmation before removing users, disabling the firewall, and uninstalling packages. Follow the prompts to clean up your system.
